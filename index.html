        <p>Hey there! I'm Tshegofatso Matsi and am a foodie who loves lasagna but got tired of making the same "traditional lasagna" the world is evolving and so is lasagna. 
            There are different types of lasagna & recipes that I am going to explore with you guys. <em><b><a href="https://italiangardensmtx.com/the-delicious-history-of-lasagna/#:~:text=Lasagna%20first%20made%20is%20a,middle%20of%20the%20Black%20Plague." target="_blank" class="link">"Lasagna"</a></b></em>. In this article, I'll be discussing some of my favourite recipes that I have discovered &  are worthy to try at home.  Let me not keep you waiting and let's get into it!!</p>

      <p>We may never know the exact person who created lasagna.
      </br>
         In fact, this dish was not named after an individual, but after a fermented noodle called laganon that was frequently used in ancient Greece where lasagna originated. In the beginning, lasagna was sprinkled with toppings, and eaten with a pointed stick.
         Unrecognizable by today’s standards, the only similarity between the two was the layering of pasta and sauce...</p>

 </br>
        <p> Fresh Spinach Ravioli blew my mind. I feel as though it falls under vegetarian category because we all know lasagna is quite meaty.
            This looks so fresh and new  try this creative recipe that uses fresh spinach filled ravioli as the pasta layer in a delightful lasagna dish. Spinach ravioli combine with ricotta cheese, artichoke hearts and a creamy spinach sauce in a lasagna dish that's baked, then browned on top for extra taste and appeal.

    </br>
     <p>This delicious dish is definitely for people who enjoy sea food & want to try something new with the lobster, instead of eating it with just melted butter. 
     </br>
        One could make lasagna with the lobster,
        the whole concept sounds divine & really classy. 
    </br>
        Lobster is a luxury food that makes the usual lasagna recipe suddenly special and elegant enough to serve to the most demanding guests.

        </div>

        <p>This is more for people who enjoy chicken more than beef. As much as beef lasagna is classy ,I think chicken lasagna is a classic dish.
        </br>
            It accommodates people who love chicken and it is very diverse, The chicken is usually spicy to bring out the flavours in the lasagna to make it tasty. The chicken is shradded just like the cheese, tomato sauce is added instead of cheese sauce.
            It is very delicious and unique & it is worthy to try out at family events.

        <p> This delightful dish caught me off guard it is quite interesting and a MUST try in my list. Pumpkin is quite sweet & I have never had a sweet pumpkin lasagna so this is quite interesting.
            This vegetarian-pumpkin-lasagna has layers of noodles and instead of meat it has pumpkin and pumpkin sauce. I want to try this as in yesterday!! , it's a different concept amongst them all and looks very yummy...

</h4>

<ul>
<li> 01 Preheat the oven to 375 F. Spray a 9 x 9-inch square pan, or another 1 1/2- to 2-quart baking dish, with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
</br>
<li>  02 Bring a large pot of water to a boil for pasta.</li>
</br>
<li> 03 In a large deep saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour and cook for one minute until the mixture turns golden.  Add the spinach and cook until barely wilted, about 2 minutes, stirring frequently.  Gradually stir in the milk, and bring the mixture to a simmer.  Allow to simmer for a minute or two,  stirring occasionally, until thickened.  Season with the nutmeg, if desired, and salt and pepper.  Stir in 1/2 cup Parmesan.</li>
</br>
<li> 04 Meanwhile, combine the ricotta cheese, lemon zest, ​and garlic in a bowl, seasoning with salt and pepper.</li>
</br>
<li> 05 When the water comes to a boil, season with salt, let it return to a boil, and cook the pasta according to package directions, stopping just before it becomes completely cooked.</li>
</br>
<li> 06 Spoon just enough creamy spinach sauce in the bottom of a lasagna dish to lightly coat it. Top with half of the ravioli, then top the pasta with a layer of half of the ricotta mixture, and half of the chopped artichokes. Spoon over half of the remaining creamy spinach sauce , then sprinkle over half of the Parmesan.  Repeat these layers.  Place in the oven and bake for about 15 minutes until everything browns and bubbles.  Run the lasagna under the broiler for a final minute to brown the top if desired.</li>
